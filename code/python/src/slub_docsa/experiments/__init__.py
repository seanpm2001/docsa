"""Various experiments.

This module contains code that is used to perform various experiments on both artificial data as well as the Qucosa
dataset. The experiments were conducted as part of an evaluation project at the SLUB Dresden. This code was not
designed to be re-used outside of these experiments. However, the code may serve as additional example code on how to
evaluate document classification models.
