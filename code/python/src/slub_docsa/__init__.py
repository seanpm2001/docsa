"""
This python package is a library for bibliographic document classification and similarity analysis.

It provides a selection of methods that support:

- pre-processing of bibliographic meta data and full-text documents,
- training of multi-label multi-class classification models,
- integrating and using hierarchical subject classifications (pruning methods, performance scores),
- similarity analysis and clustering.

Some important features include:

- a concise API for training and evaluating multi-label multi-class classification models, see `slub_docsa.common`
- support for many different classification approaches, see `slub_docsa.models`
- artificial hierarchical random datasets, see `slub_docsa.data.artificial`
- performance scores that consider hierarchical relations, see `slub_docsa.evaluation.score`
